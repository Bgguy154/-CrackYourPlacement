//             The syntax for(auto el:mp) is a C++11 (and later) range-based for loop. This loop is used to iterate over all elements in a container, such as a map (std::map), which is often abbreviated as mp. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

//     auto: This keyword automatically deduces the type of el based on the type of elements in the container mp.
//     el: This is the loop variable that will take the value of each element in the container as the loop iterates.
//     mp: This is the container being iterated over

            result.push_back(el.second);
        }
        return result;
    }
